        summary: 'Many PHP applications need to store files. There are many different reasons to store file, and not all filesystems are created equally. How can we identify our needs? Which filesystem is best for your use-case? How can we ensure our future needs are not blocked by the code we write today? In this talk we''ll explore how filesystem abstraction and general coding guidelines can improve our application''s and make them future proof!'

        summary: 'The Messenger component brings asynchronous processing to Symfony: using message bus(es) you are able to decouple your application and route some (or all) of these "messages" to transports such as the built-in AMQP transport. It’s been more than 6 months since we’ve merged the new Messenger component in Symfony. We will explore the different use cases it has been used for so far and how it will continue to involve in order to facilitate even more.'

We will look at Edge Side Includes (ESI) to tailor caching rules of fragments, and at the user context concept to differentiate caches not by individual user but by permission groups. A big help to leverage this concept is the FOSHttpCache in combination with either Varnish or the Symfony HttpCache reverse proxy.'

        author: 'Christopher Hertel'
        summary: 'With the popularisation of DDD people started shifting from anemic models with only getters and setters to a rich model describing the state changes in specific methods. This way of designing models does not play well with Symfony forms. User provided input is inherently invalid while we want to maintain certain invariants in our domain model. A common approach to overcome these limitations is to create data transfer objects our forms are then bound to. This can lead to lots of mapping & glue code that might be cumbersome to write and maintain.'

MongoDB and its PHP driver have an array of features that can greatly improve an application''s resiliency in the face of unexpected errors. This talk will examine how the driver monitors connections to a cluster and look at how we can tune its behavior to meet an application''s unique needs. We''ll also demonstrate how PHP applications can take advantage of newer features such as retryable writes and multi-document transactions to guarantee ACID data integrity without having to fall back to PDO and an SQL database.'

        author: 'Kévin Dunglas'
        summary: 'Thanks to the new capabilities of the web platform (web components, Progressive Web Apps…) and the rise of modern JS libraries (Vue, React, Angular) almost all modern Symfony applications must leverage the frontend ecosystem. Symfony 4 embed many gems that make it easy to integrate modern JavaScript within the framework, including the first component entirely written in JS: Webpack Encore. In Symfony 4.2, another component that is super convenient for apps containing JS code has been released: Panther, a PHP library compatible with BrowserKit, that drives real web browsers to create end-to-end (E2E) tests with ease. During this talk, I''ll show you how to cleanly integrate modern JavaScript code with Symfony and Twig and how to test such applications using Panther. The examples will use VueJS, because it’s probably the easiest JS framework to get started with as a PHP developer, but all the tips and tricks will be applicable with other libraries such as React or Angular.'
